### Cluster Analysis: Creating, Visualizing and Interpreting Customer Segments

One project that I am proud of is exploring and implementing unsupervised methods for clustering customer data. Unlike supervised machine learning techniques that require labeled data, unsupervised methods allow for the grouping of data into previously unseen clusters, revealing new insights about the customer base. Throughout the project, I utilized various methods for cluster analysis and dimensionality reduction to visualize and interpret the resulting clusters. By closely examining the impactful features within each cluster, I was able to uncover valuable information about customer behavior and preferences. I found this project to be highly rewarding as it allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of unsupervised learning techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios. It was also gratifying to uncover new insights that could potentially lead to improved customer engagement and retention strategies for the organization.
